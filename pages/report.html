                            May 26-29: We came up with the idea of making a
                            little plant growing system and also drew pictures
                            quickly so that everyone understands. William is
                            creating a quick model on TickerCAD for our
                            proposal. We are all also working on the proposal
                            thinking about the measurements and the materials we
                            need.

                            Contributors: Everyone <br />
                            Completed on June 05 <br />
                            Finding the materials we needed for our product was
                            a challenge as the first idea involved a whole
                            enclosed system. It took us basically everyday to
                            find the right materials that were needed. <br />
                            June 01: We had the alligator clips and nails + our
                            Micro:bit <br />
                            June 02: Everyone actively tried to come up with
                            ideas of what we needed in the original design of
                            our product which was enclosed. This involved
                            thinking of buying two clear boxes and a slider plus
                            a spring which we can cut out along with 4 slotted
                            angles to support the structure. We did some
                            research on the materials, found out that the
                            original design had too many flaws and decided to
                            come up with a new design. <br />
                            June 03: Chris and William found slotted angles in
                            the scrap room and decided to use it in our build.
                            At this point we thought of a new design that was
                            much more simple involving turing piping to stop the
                            water from flowing as well as letting it flow
                            (credits to Mr. Lu for helping us find this new
                            solution and also providing the tubing), so we got
                            wires. William also brought 2 flower pots from home
                            to use in our build. We also got a plastic water
                            bottle that would work as the water supply for the
                            watering system. <br />
                            June 04: Michael found a slotted angle that was the
                            exact height as one that was previously found. Along
                            with that, we found some 3D prints that we could use
                            for the base and covering. Jason also asked for a
                            Sensor:bit and servos motor as we needed some more
                            pins to control the watering system. <br />
                            June 05: We got the 3V battery that was required for
                            powering the Micro:bit as well as the 9V battery to
                            power the servos which required 4.5-6V. The battery
                            had only like 7V so it worked fine. Mr. Lu also
                            found us a 3D print circle and a cone shaped funnel
                            which we used to hold the water bottle. <br />

                            Completed June 15 <br />
                            June 05-07: Coded the css styling, planned the pages
                            we needed (product, build, source code pages) and
                            created html layout. <br />
                            June 08: Made the header stick and then put the
                            pages on the top right corner for anchors to link to
                            the different pages. <br />
                            June 09: Decided to make a navbar which will have
                            anchor links that will jump to the different
                            sections of the page and also decide how the
                            categories were organized. I also decide what would
                            be put on each page. <br />
                            June 10: Created and styled some div boxes and put
                            some images and text as placeholders until
                            information for the boxes were acquired. <br />
                            June 11-12: Finished the company title page with the
                            introduction, our team, and a quick brief of the
                            features of our product. <br />
                            June 13-14: Got the codes for the Micro:bit and put
                            them into different selections on different events:
                            forever, button pressed, logo pressed, etc. I
                            decided that the code was too long to just put it in
                            the html so I decided to put it in a txt file and
                            fetch it by Javascript then implement it onto the
                            page. Also made a code block style for code text.
                            All the codes were in the source code page along
                            with documentations that I wrote for the lines of
                            code and were looked over by group members to check
                            for grammatical errors. <br />
                            June 15: Finished the build page that had all the
                            models, electrical circuit diagram as well as us
                            testing the different parts of our product (servos
                            and moisture sensor). I also added a manual to the
                            main product page to explain what each button on the
                            Micro:bit did when it was implemented into our
                            product. <br />

                            June 02-03: William started working on tinkercad to
                            build the design to scale and so we know how we are
                            going to build our product. At the same time,
                            Michael used tinkercad to test the micro bit with
                            moisture detectors and servos. <br />
                            June 04: Everyone worked together to start
                            assembling our product, we screwed the slotted angle
                            onto the black cross we found for the base and the
                            top, we then attached the micro bit and Sensor:bit
                            to the top of our design. We were debating on where
                            we should put the servo so we didn’t attach that
                            yet. William and Jason soldered 2 wires together to
                            create a ground that could connect to the
                            Sensor:bit, battery and the servo. <br />
                            June 05: Jason, Michael and William attached the
                            battery pack onto the slotted angle of our design
                            and we also screwed in the 3D print circle to the
                            top of our build. The servo would only go on our
                            design after we had coded it and checked everything
                            to make sure it worked. <br />

                            June 01: We got the moisture sensor and Micro:bit to
                            test the moisture sensor part of our build. We went
                            outside to get a video recording, however we had
                            trouble recording the information presented by the
                            LEDs because the sun was bright. We stuck it into
                            the earth and confirmed that it worked. <br />
                            June 03: We got tubing and a plastic water bottle to
                            test how the water will drip into the plant. Made a
                            mess with water everywhere, but had a plan of how it
                            would work. <br />
                            June 04: We got skeptical that the moisture sensor
                            wasn’t working so we decided to test on dried paper
                            towels. We kept getting 1023 which was the max value
                            and it didn’t make sense, however we found errors in
                            the code and fixed it. We also learned that
                            connectivity issues could also result in the wrong
                            readings so we had to be careful how we wire
                            managed. <br />
                            June 05-06: We had trouble with the servos and
                            deciding where to put it with consideration of the
                            moisture sensor as well. We ended up using pins 1
                            and 2 for the moisture sensor and then pin 16 for
                            the servos. We tested it with a small servo, however
                            it was not strong enough and so we needed a bigger
                            and stronger one. But there were challenges with
                            needing it to be connected to an external battery
                            which we figured out on the last day of testing our
                            prototype. <br />

                            June 02: Jason wrote a code for the moisture sensor
                            using the reference we found online. <br />
                            June 04: Jason edited the code for the moisture
                            sensor part. <br />
                            June 05: Jason wrote a code for the servos to work
                            and since we had time, he also finished writing all
                            of the code for our product so it could be tested
                            the next day. Chris checked it at home and made some
                            changes to the code so that it ran smoother. He
                            didn’t like how Jason organised it but still, some
                            lines in the code could be better. We were on a
                            tight schedule to have it tested the next day and
                            any major changes could break what we already had
                            which was working perfectly well. <br />

                            June 05: Jason was coding some parts to the
                            Micro:bit and we also tested it to make sure it
                            worked outside the simulation. <br />
                            June 06: The code was done and so we tested it in
                            real life. It didn’t work at first as for some minor
                            bugs and unnecessary code so we had to change some
                            of it like conflict in the forever loop with the
                            moisture sensor and activating the servos to turn in
                            auto and manual mode. Also we needed to know the
                            angle the servos were to turn. <br />

                            June 07: Everyone worked together to figure out
                            where the servo would go on the design so it would
                            not interfere with the tubing where water comes out
                            and the servo also had to be at a place where it was
                            higher than the water before turning so water does
                            not leak out. <br />
                            June 08: After testing where the servo should go,
                            everyone helped with putting the servo onto the
                            design at a place where the tube won’t be affected
                            and where the water would not spill out of the pot
                            when the servo turns. <br />

                            June 14: After we attached everything on our build,
                            we had to test everything to see if it works. First,
                            before testing the actual parts of our build, we
                            found out that when the water bottle is on our
                            design, one side gets too heavy and will tip over if
                            the water bottle is full. We decided to get open the
                            water bottle and not fill it all the way so one side
                            won’t be too heavy. After we got that figured out,
                            we had to test to see if our moisture detector works
                            and it did. Next, we checked the servos, turns out
                            the servos wouldn’t turn even after plugging in
                            everything. We ended up not figuring out the reason
                            for it on this day. <br />
                            June 15: Chris and William got Mr. Lu to help us
                            with testing the servo and it turns out that the
                            servos were fine, so we experimented a bit more,
                            switching wires, soldering more wires and finally,
                            after we switched the 6V battery for the 9V battery,
                            the servo started to work. With that, we have
                            finished testing everything and our build is working
                            fine. <br />

                            June 17: Chris pinged everyone with this message:
                            “Tomorrow we should decide on a time on how we will
                            be presenting our product to the teacher. We also
                            need to brief everyone on the product so we know
                            what we are saying and don't cut each other off
                            (like a presentation). Me and William finished the
